# Basic-Calculator

A basic calculator Android application. A library called [mXparser](http://mathparser.org/) was also used to evaluate the expression in the PEMDAS order of operations. This application also fully supports landscape layout and decimal numbers. It also dynamically evaluates the expression as you input it.
